    ✅ Modular project structure (auth, products, cart, profile, visuals)

    ✅ Customizable user profile

    ✅ Informative error responses

🗄️ Database
🔧 MySQL + SQLAlchemy

Tables are designed to match Pydantic schemas and are validated for integrity.
📊 Main Tables
Table	Purpose
users	Stores login, password hash, role (user/admin), and registration date
products	Product details: name, description, price, category
cart_items	Associates users with their shopping cart items
visual_items	Visual assets (avatars, banners) with type, price, and image path
user_visuals	Links users to purchased visual items
user_settings	Stores currently active avatar and banner for a user

🔁 Caching
🔧 Redis (redis-py)

    🔄 Caches product list responses

    ⏱ Configurable TTL (time-to-live) for cached data

    🧠 If cache is missing, data is pulled from MySQL and stored back in Redis

    📉 Reduces database load and improves performance

🎨 Profile Customization
📌 User Features

    👤 View profile with current avatar and banner

    🛍 Browse the visual item store

    💰 Purchase avatars or banners using internal currency

    🖼 Apply selected customization (saved in DB and shown in profile)

📦 Implementation

    Each visual item has a type (avatar or banner) and a price

    Users can view owned and unowned visual assets

    Selecting a visual item updates the user's profile in real-time
